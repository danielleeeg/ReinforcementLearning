# README: Q-Learning Pathfinding Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing and training an intelligent agent to solve a maze-based pathfinding problem using Q-learning and reinforcement learning techniques. The primary goal was to build a pirate-themed intelligent agent capable of navigating through a maze to find treasure. The work involved creating and training a neural network to make decisions based on exploration and exploitation strategies, with the ultimate goal of maximizing rewards and achieving a high win rate.

### Code Contributions
1. **Provided Code**:  
   - The foundational structure of the maze environment (`TreasureMaze.py`).
   - The experience replay mechanism (`GameExperience.py`).
   - Neural network model initialization and related components.
   
2. **COntributed Code**:  
   - Implementation of the `qtrain` function, including exploration and exploitation mechanisms using epsilon decay, experience replay, and neural network training.
   - Epsilon decay logic for shifting from high exploration to low exploration rates episode-by-episode (minimum 10% exploration).
   - Win rate tracking and training termination conditions.

## Learning Connection to Computer Science

### What Do Computer Scientists Do, and Why Does It Matter?
Computer scientists design, implement, and optimize algorithms to solve complex problems. This often involves creating systems that can learn from data, automate decision-making, and operate efficiently under various constraints. By addressing challenges like pathfinding, machine learning, and AI development, computer scientists contribute to advancements in technology that improve daily life, from navigation systems to autonomous vehicles and beyond.

### Approaching Problems as a Computer Scientist
As a computer scientist, problem-solving involves:
1. **Defining the Problem**: Breaking down a challenge into discrete, solvable components. In this project, the problem was navigating a maze using reinforcement learning.
2. **Designing the Solution**: Developing a systematic approach to address the problem, such as Q-learning with experience replay for pathfinding.
3. **Implementing and Testing**: Writing modular, reusable code and validating it against edge cases to ensure reliability.
4. **Iterating and Optimizing**: Refining algorithms and improving performance based on results, such as tuning the epsilon decay rate for better convergence.

### Ethical Responsibilities
1. **To the End User**: 
   - Ensure that intelligent systems prioritize user safety and minimize bias.
